Hello, I'm Choi Soo In.
I'm interested in the back end, and I'm studying the front end together.
So I am learning many programming languages such as C, Java, MySQL, JavaScript, Oracle, HTML, CSS, JSP, LINUX, etc.

I am developing a school portal site and application by teaming with Kim Tae-wan, Kim Won-jung, and Choi Hae-sung as a joint project.
I think I can make a big achievement by developing a cool app.
